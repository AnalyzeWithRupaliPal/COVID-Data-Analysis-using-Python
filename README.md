# COVID-Data-Analysis-using-Python
Overview

This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights using Python. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical modeling to provide actionable insights into the pandemic's impact.

Objectives

Clean and preprocess COVID-19 datasets.

Analyze trends in cases, recoveries, and fatalities.

Visualize data to identify regional and temporal patterns.

Perform statistical and predictive analysis to forecast trends.

Key Features

Data Collection: Import data from reliable sources like Johns Hopkins University or WHO.

Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize data, and aggregate metrics.

Visualization: Create charts and graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Predictive Modeling: Use libraries like Scikit-learn to build models for forecasting cases.

Tools and Technologies

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

Data Sources: CSV/Excel files from trusted health organizations.

IDE: Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

Deliverables
